# RecurrentEvents Module

Small zome to manage the recurrent-events in your DNA, in RSM.

This module is designed to be included in other DNAs, assuming as little as possible from those. It is packaged as a holochain zome, and an npm package that offers native Web Components that can be used across browsers and frameworks.

> Notice that this zome still stores all recurrent-events in the DNA in which the zome is included. Integration and bridging with personas & recurrent-events will be done in the future, maintaining as much as possible the current API.
